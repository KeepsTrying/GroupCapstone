3 person group creating blog site for someone w/o programming knowledge to update


I was the DBA, in charge of designing database architecture and creating queries and populate scripts.

Also created all of the wireframes (which I can add to my google drive and allow you to view if you would like, please email me via the email listed on my resume) for the site.

Help in DAO creations (if the prepared statement has any of the SQL keywords in ALL CAPS then I created the method).  
Also did a fair amount of the unit testing (if a unit test uses Assert.assertEquals/Assert.assertTrue it was my creation; as opposed to just assertEquals/assertTrue)

Created the front end validation for the author portal page, as well as the adding/removing of it for the hidden items.  Also the validation for the adding category modal.

Created the dynamic overlay of blog post info on the homepage previews. (the transparent popup when you mouse over a preview pic on homepage)

Created the search function which correctly searches through #tags and also categories.

Created the getVerifiedAssociatedTags() method in the JFoTagServiceLayer, which also shows some understanding of regex.  (believe it may be better to use the "g" global than the .replaceAll())

Created the pagination on the Admin Post and Page portals.  This includes the entire AdminRestController.  Was NOT the one to attempt the pagination of the preview items on the home page.

I may be forgetting some items I had a good part in but the above listed is the bulk of it.  This project was 3 people including myself and less than two weeks of work.  I had a wonderful team and would be honored to work with them again!

If you have any questions or comments please feel free to email/call/text me.
